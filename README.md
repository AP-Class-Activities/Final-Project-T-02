# Market Application
This is an application in which you can have some stores. In each store there is an operator (who owns the store), and there are some users, sellers, and products.


 # How to Use
To start using the application just run the *main.py* file.
**Note:** You must have *python* and *PyQt5* and *matplotlib* installed on your system to be able to use this application.


# Database Sample
If you just want to test out the applicaion without having to make everything from scratch yourself, just **uncomment** the *Database Sample* section of *main.py* and run it. but remember to **comment it back out** so that your database is not deleted everytime you run the application.


# Code
This project has two major parts:
1. Back-end
2. Front-end

Back-end is where the database is managed and all datatypes are made and every feature of the application is made possible. It consists of four files:
- *Product.py*
- *Store.py*
- *User.py*
- *Seller.py*

Front-end is the where the GUI is handled. Every file that ends with *Ui* is part of the front-end.
